			<h2 class="ingredientsdir"><span>Directions:</span></h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Mix together the flour and 1 1/2 cups room temperature water in a bowl. Knead the dough well until it is medium-firm and flexible. Cover and let rest for 1 hour.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, mix together the chicken, cilantro, onions, garlic, ginger, cumin, cinnamon, 2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl.</li>
				<li>To make the wrappers: Break off 1/2 ounce of dough and forming it into a ball. Place the ball on a flat surface and roll it into a 4-inch round with a rolling pin. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
				<li>Spray a steamer pan with cooking spray.</li>
				<li>Place a tablespoon of the chicken filling in the middle of a wrapper. Holding the wrapper in your left hand. Use your right thumb and index finger to start pinching the edges of the wrapper together. Pinch and fold until the edges of the circle close up like a little satchel. Place the momo in the prepared steamer pan. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
				<li>Fill the steamer pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Set the steamer pan with the momos on top of the pot and cover with a tight lid. Steam the momos until cooked, 8 to 9 minutes.</li>
				<p>Well, Momo makes a full lunch on a single plate. The flavor comes next. Momo is made with special spices that give it a distinctive and original flavor that appeals to the Nepalese palette. The lengthy history of momo is the third factor. Momo has been a staple of the national diet and culture of Nepal for many years. The fourth is that it is accessible. It can be found in any restaurant or hotel, no matter how big or little, wherever in the nation. So what are the components and how are momos made? Wheat flour, vegetable oil, chopped onion, garlic, sesame, green chilies, tomatoes, meat (ideally buff), mustard powder, ginger juice, and a combination of Nepalese herbal spices are the ingredients used to make momo.</p>
